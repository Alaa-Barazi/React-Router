# React-Router
<br/>
We are going to create a small part of an e-commerce website.
We will provide you with some product data and you need to
display them on the screen correctly using React Router.

<br/>
This exercise is divided into 4 parts

<br/>
Part 1 <br/>
Before displaying our products on the screen let's create our <br/>
components and wire up our React Router. <br/>
Create the components <br/>
1. Homepage component <br/>
2. Products component <br/>
3. Header component <br/>

<br/>
React Router <br/>
Homepage component path is “/” <br/> 
Products component path is “/products” <br/>
Header component should always be visible <br/>

<br/>
Part 2 <br/>
Let's create and display our data on the screen <br/>
Our data 
Create a store.js file inside src folder. <br/>
Store data in a variable and export default it.

<br/>
Store it to State <br/>
Import this file to your Products component. <br/>
When the component mounts to the screen, store it in the
components state. <br/>
Display the products <br/>
Display only each product title on the screen <br/>

<br/>
Part 4 <br/> 
Let's finish up with some final touches <br/>
ProductDetail back button <br/>
Create a back button in our ProductDetail component that will <br/>
direct back to the products page with the help of the Link tag. <br/>
Header links <br/>
Create the following links <br/>
1. Link to the homepage <br/>
2. Link to the products page <br/>
